# Repository Merge Fix

## Problem
The `main` and `master` branches had no common ancestor, preventing normal merges. The `main` branch only contained a LICENSE file, while `master` contained the full project code.

## Solution Applied
This PR includes a merge that unifies the code history by:

1. Merging `master` branch into `main` using `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag
2. Bringing all the project code from `master` into the current branch
3. Making it possible to merge this PR into `main`

## What This PR Contains
This PR now includes all the code from the `master` branch:
- Complete backend implementation with Express.js and PostgreSQL
- Authentication and JWT middleware
- Database migrations and seed scripts
- Deployment and development scripts
- Comprehensive documentation

## After Merging This PR
After this PR is merged into `main`:
- The `main` branch will have the full project code
- The `main` and `master` branches will be unified
- Future PRs can be created normally against `main`
- The `master` and `structure` branches can be deleted if desired

## Manual Steps (If Needed)
If you need to update `main` directly on GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kyanwick/pbj.git
cd pbj

# Fetch all branches
git fetch --all

# Checkout main
git checkout main

# Merge master with unrelated histories
git merge master --allow-unrelated-histories -m "Merge master branch into main to unify code history"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

This will ensure `main` has all the code from `master` and future merges will work normally.

## Security Notes
During the merge, a security scan was performed on the code. The following non-critical issues were identified in the pre-existing code (from the master branch):

- **Missing rate limiting**: The backend API routes (lines 38-40 in `backend/server.js`) do not have rate limiting implemented. This could make the API vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding rate limiting middleware (e.g., using `express-rate-limit` package) to protect the API endpoints in a future update.
